House Prices (Python)

In this project, I'll develop prediction models using the house prices dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to demonstrate the 4 steps of the Data Science project lifecycle: Define, Discover, Develop and Deploy.  I will build several supervised machine learning models and evaulate the performance.

### 1. Define: 

The objective of this ML exercise is to predict house prices using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset.


### 2. Discover: 

### 3. Develop:

### 4. Deploy:
